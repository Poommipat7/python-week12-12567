#3.Comparison Operator
a = 10
b = 12
c = 15
d = 18

#3.1 Output=>: a > b is fasle
print('a > b is',a > b)

#3.2 Output=>: a < b is True
print('a > b is',a < b)

#3.3 Output=>: a == b is fasle
print('a == b is',a == b)

#3.4 Output=>: a >= b is True
print('a > b is',a < b)

#3.5 Output=>: a >= b is fasle
print('a >= b is',a >= b)

#3.6 Output=>: a <= b is True
print('a <= b is',a <= b)

#3.7 Equal to operator
print('c = d is',c = d)

#3.8 not Equal to operator
print('c != d is',c != d)

#3.9 Greater than Operator
print('c > d is',c > d)

#3.10 Less than operator
print('c < d is',c < d)

#3.11 Greater or equal to operator
print('c >= d is',c >= d)
